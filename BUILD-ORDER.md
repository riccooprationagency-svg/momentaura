# Build order

Each step is one prompt. Do not skip ahead — later steps assume the tokens and
components from earlier ones exist.

## 1 — Foundation
Scaffold Astro, static output, no integrations. Add `src/styles/tokens.css` verbatim.
Write `global.css`: font-face blocks, reset, base elements, layout primitives, the
`.docket` and `.photo-pending` classes. Fonts into `public/fonts/`.

**Check:** a blank page renders in Archivo at the right size. Nothing else.

## 2 — Layout shell
`Base.astro` — head, nav, footer, skip link. Nav transparent over the hero, Packing Dark
on scroll. Vertical edge label, desktop only.

**Check:** nav and footer on an empty page, both viewports.

## 3 — Product data
`src/data/products.json`. Every product carries `photo` (null until a real photograph
exists), `system` derived from it, contents, price, leadTimeDays, stock, and run fields
for limited items.

## 4 — Components, in this order
`Docket.astro` → `ProductCard.astro` → `DispatchRule.astro` → `Button.astro`

**`CapacityNotice.astro` is deliberately not built.** Every number it would
render — production capacity, cut-off date, run size, remaining — is currently
unknown, and CLAUDE.md is explicit that a component whose numbers cannot be
verified does not render. Build it when there is a real run with a real count.
This is a decision, not a gap.

Build and verify each in isolation before composing. The docket is the signature
element — get it right before anything depends on it.

## 5 — Homepage
Hero (static image, video slot empty) → dispatch rule → six category tiles → product
reveals, one per section.

**Check:** transfer under 500KB. Measure, do not estimate.

## 6 — Category and product pages
Category: straight grid, no 100vh rhythm. Product: two columns, docket, size selector,
quantity, one filled button.

## 7 — Cart
localStorage only. `client:idle`.

No quote path in v1. This is an apparel store with a cart. The 10-unit quote route
and the Order Bar's "Request a quote" behaviour in `docs/STYLE-dark-editorial.md`
are both gifting-era and do not apply.

## 8 — Checkout
Cloudflare Function. Re-price server-side. Redirect to the hosted gateway page.
**No card field on our domain.**

## 9 — M-Pesa (only once the business shortcode exists)
Cloudflare KV for pending orders. STK Push → callback → status-query fallback.
Idempotent by `CheckoutRequestID`.

## 10 — Trust pages
Delivery, About, Contact, Privacy, `/track`. `/track` takes order reference plus phone —
no accounts, no passwords.

## 11 — Ship
Sitemap, Open Graph images, Search Console. Test on a real phone on Safaricom data.
